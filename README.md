Combined Cycle Power Plant Performance Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the performance of a Combined Cycle Power Plant using artificial neural networks. The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. As an electrical engineer, I found this dataset intriguing and decided to build a regression model for predicting power plant performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are crucial factors affecting the efficiency of a combined cycle power plant.

Neural Network Model
I employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform regression on the dataset. The model architecture, hyperparameters, and training details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The performance of the ANN regression model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 3.94 
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 24.6
- **R-squared:** 0.91
